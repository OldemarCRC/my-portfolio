            <strong>Meet JosÃ©</strong><br />
            Hello! My name is JosÃ© Oldemar Chaves Urbina.
            I was born {age} years ago in the city of Puerto LimÃ³n, Caribbean coast of Costa Rica,
            and now I reside in Helsinki, Finland.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            <strong>A Journey in Logistics</strong><br />
            My professional journey began after obtaining a technical diploma in accounting
            from a vocational college in Costa Rica,
            complemented by my upper secondary education equivalent
            to the Finnish "<span lang="fi">Lukio</span>".
            I spent over two decades in logistics,
            focusing on imports and exports.
            My career ranged from working at the
            Costa Rican Customs Office to various roles
            in customs agencies, shipping agencies,
            and as a dispatcher at maritime container terminals,
            including experience at Costa Rica's
            most significant port terminal in MoÃ­n
            and more recently at Posti's logistics center
            in Vantaa, Finland.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            <strong>Diving into Software Development</strong><br />
            In 2024, I completed an ICT and Software Development degree
            <span lang="fi">(Tieto- ja viestintÃ¤tekniikan perustutkinto)</span> at
            Vantaan Ammattiopisto Varia
            in Finland.
            Since then, I have continued expanding my technical skills
            through courses in Python programming, DevOps with Docker,
            discrete mathematics, and SQL databases,
            building a solid foundation in modern software development
            practices.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            <strong>Bridging Logistics and Technology</strong><br />
            My extensive logistics background provides me with
            invaluable insights into supply chain operations,
            inventory systems, and the practical challenges of
            global trade. This real-world experience positions
            me uniquely in the tech sectorâ€”I understand both
            the business processes and the technical solutions.
            Whether developing logistics software,
            providing IT support for supply chain systems,
            or optimizing operational workflows,
            I can bridge the communication gap between technical
            teams and logistics operations.
            I speak both languages: the language of developers
            and the language of warehouse managers, dispatchers,
            and supply chain coordinators.
            This dual perspective enables me to create
            user-centered solutions that truly address
            operational needs, not just technical requirements.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            <strong>Beyond the Professional</strong><br />
            Outside of my professional interests, I am an avid football player and swimmer,
            enjoying both sports at an amateur level. I also take pleasure in running,
            having completed several half-marathons, including one in Helsinki.
            In addition, I relish the tranquility of Finnish lakes and the rejuvenating
            experience of a sauna.
          </p>
          <p className="lead">
            <strong>A Unique Perspective</strong><br />
            This blend of international logistics experience and a fresh foray into IT,
            combined with my multicultural life journey, shapes my unique perspective and
            approach to problem-solving in the tech world. I am excited about the opportunities
            that lie ahead in my new career path and am eager to contribute my skills and
            experiences in new and challenging environments.
