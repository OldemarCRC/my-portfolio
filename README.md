Welcome to My Portfolio
Hello! I'm Oldemar Chaves, a passionate developer with a keen interest in Python, data science, artificial intelligence. This repository, my-portfolio, serves as a window into my professional and personal world, where I share the projects I've worked on, my achievements, and everything that excites me in the vast universe of technology.

About Me
Hello! My name is José Oldemar Chaves Urbina, but most people know me as Oldemar. I was born 54 years ago in the city of Puerto Limón, Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, and now I reside in the modern city of Helsinki, Finland.

My professional journey began after obtaining a technical diploma in accounting from a vocational college in Costa Rica, complemented by my upper secondary education equivalent to the Finnish "Lukio". I spent over two decades in logistics, focusing on imports and exports. My career ranged from working at the Costa Rican Customs Office to various roles in customs agencies, shipping agencies, and as a dispatcher at maritime container terminals, including Costa Rica's most significant port terminal in Moín.

I recently completed an ICT and Software Development (Tieto- ja viestintätekniikan perustutkinto) at Vantaan Ammattiopisto Varia in Finland, which has provided me with strong foundations in software development and information technology.

With my background in logistics, I bring a deep understanding of supply chains, inventory management, and the complexities of global trade. By combining this with my programming skills, I am now able to build solutions that streamline operations, automate processes, and improve decision-making. This fusion of logistics and technology allows me to create software that not only addresses the technical aspects but also takes into account the real-world challenges businesses face in logistics and supply chain management.

Outside of my professional interests, I am an avid football player and swimmer, enjoying both sports at an amateur level. I also take pleasure in running, having completed several half-marathons, including one in Helsinki. In addition, I relish the tranquility of Finnish lakes and the rejuvenating experience of a sauna.

This blend of international logistics experience and a fresh foray into IT, combined with my multicultural life journey, shapes my unique perspective and approach to problem-solving in the tech world. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in my new career path and am eager to contribute my skills and experiences in new and challenging environments.
